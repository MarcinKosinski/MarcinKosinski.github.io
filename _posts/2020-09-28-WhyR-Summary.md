# Numbers

<img src="/images/fulls/whyr2020/summary/Slajd3.JPG" class="fit image"> This was the first virtual but the fourth edition of the annual conference devoted to R users in Central-Eastern Europe. This year we had a chance to gather participants from all over the world, thanks to the remote setup! We had +950 registered participants for lectures, 300 R users initially interested in [Text Mining Hackathon](https://2020.whyr.pl/hackathon/) and 320 taken seats for remote [2020.whyr.pl/workshops/](https://2020.whyr.pl/workshops/). In the end, during the week after the first published Keynote talk we observed **+16k views and 2.5k total watch hours**.
