# Summary of three years of the group activity

At the beggining of the meeting, the initiator of the Warsaw R Enthusiasts Group, [Przemysław Biecek](http://biecek.pl/), gave a talk during which he summed up the last 3 years or our activities and presented main activities around R package in Poland in last several years. 
The presentation is available [here](https://github.com/mi2-warsaw/SER/blob/master/histoRia/SER_Trzecie_Urodziny.pdf). 
Attendees could learn some history of the R expansions in Poland and were introduced to R applications in Poland in fields like: insurances, technological industry, health service, weather forecasting.

> If you haven't had a chance to see that presentation, you might consider attending next (20th) Poznań R Users Group ([PAZUR](https://www.meetup.com/Poznan-R-User-Group-PAZUR/events/237450288/)) meeting (23rd March), where Przemysław will show a similar talk.

During those 3 years we grown so much that we exceeded 1300 users on our [meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Spotkania-Entuzjastow-R-Warsaw-R-Users-Group-Meetup/). Together we have had 44 presentations, 13 workshops, 2 data analysis hackathons, 1 meeting with a machine learning videos from youtube, we have supported the organization of the [European R Users Meeting](http://erum.ue.poznan.pl/) and we have started organizing Polish R Users Conference -  [**Why R? 2017**](http://whyr.pl/). 


# Toast

After the presentation we had a cake and the champagne. The toast for 3 consecutive years of successful meetings, raised more than 50 people.
We even had the honor to host the representation of **trigeR** ([TriCity R Enthusiasts Group](https://www.meetup.com/Trojmiejska-Grupa-Entuzjastow-R/events/236257032/)), **STWUR** ([Wroclaw R Users Association](https://www.meetup.com/Wroclaw-R-Users-Group/)) and [R-Ladies Warsaw Group](https://www.meetup.com/Spotkania-Entuzjastow-R-Warsaw-R-Users-Group-Meetup/events/237953300/) (that are co-organized next to Warsaw R Enthusiasts Group).

# Round tables session

> Round table is a form of academic discussion. Participants agree on a specific topic to discuss and debate. Each person is given equal right to participate, as illustrated by the idea of a circular layout referred to in the term round table. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_table_(discussion))

As this is becoming more popular, we organized a round tables session with 6 various topics, including: R in education, R in business, Machine Learning, Shiny + Rmarkdown, R Freelancing, R integrations with other tools. Tables can be seen on this occasional photo of all attendees of the session. We planned a 1 hour long discussion but few tables lasted longer. Last attendees left the event almost 4 hours after we started the meeting.

# WRUG baseball jackets

Yes! It's not a coincidence that few people from a previous photo have the same outfit! For that occasion [Alicja Gosiewska](https://github.com/agosiewska) and [Aleksandra Dąbrowska](https://github.com/AleksandraDabrowska) (our new co-organizers) prepared baseball jackets of Warsaw R Enthusiasts Group. So far 21 participants have ordered such gifts. I appealed this initiative so much that I have decided to subsidize those baseball jackets a bit.

# wser.pl, a new logo and occasional stickers

We went even further, and created (with a help of [Emil Buszyło](https://github.com/EmilBuszylo/)) a new website of Warsaw R Enthusiasts Group (in polish: *Warszawskie Spotkania Entuzjastów R* (WSER)). It's available here - [wser.pl](http://wser.pl/) (still a little bit under construction). I am amazed by the timeline of our meetings. Baseball jackets, the website and occasional stickers were enriched by the new logo (by Klaudia Korniluk from [Pędzlenie na zlecenie](https://www.facebook.com/pedzlenie/)).
