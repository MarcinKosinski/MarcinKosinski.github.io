<img src="/images/fulls/whyr2020/hackathon/fri.jpg" class="fit image"> Dear R Enthusiasts! Today at [Why R? 2020 conference](https://2020.whyr.pl) we host a Discussion Panel by McKinsey & Company **Lessons learned from 500+ Data Science interviews** (1pm-2pm UTC+2) - [stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAZ_P8LJPnw&feature=youtu.be)

The goal of this session, organized by McKinsey, is to share lessons learned from the 500+ interviews for data science jobs conducted over the last three years by McKinsey's Central Europe Advanced Analytics Hub. McKinsey recruiters and data scientists will share their experience of both interviewing candidates and being interviewed, providing practical tips on how best to:

- Write a résumé
- Prepare for interview
- Fine tune your communication style
- Build your personal story
- Problem-solve analytical cases studies
- Identify and demonstrate your strengths

The session will end with a Q&A.

We end the day with **McKinsey & Company Booth** for an open conversation on a Zoom meeting (5:30pm-6:15pm UTC+2) [2020.whyr.pl/mckinsey/booth/](https://2020.whyr.pl/mckinsey/booth/)
