<img src="/images/fulls/whyr2020/keynotes/silge.jpg" class="fit image"> **Data visualization for machine learning practitioners** is the title of [Why R? Keynote Kick Off by Julia Silge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH_lt8qlSJw) that starts today at 5pm UTC!. You can find all scheduled talks on our [youtube.com/WhyRFoundation](https://youtube.com/WhyRFoundation) channel.

The talk will start the **Text Mining Hackathon** [2020.whyr.pl/hackaton/](https://2020.whyr.pl/hackaton/). At the time of the talk we will announce challenges for the hackathon for which you have 24 hours to propose solutions to. You can still register to the hackathon

Below you can find biogram of Julia and the abstract of the talk.

**Bio**: Julia Silge is a data scientist and software engineer at RStudio PBC where she works on open source modeling tools. She is an author, an international keynote speaker, and a real-world practitioner focusing on data analysis and machine learning practice. Julia loves text analysis, making beautiful charts, and communicating about technical topics with diverse audiences. 

**Description**: Visual representations of data inform how machine learning practitioners think, understand, and decide. Before charts are ever used for outward communication about a ML system, they are used by the system designers and operators themselves as a tool to make better modeling choices. Practitioners use visualization, from very familiar statistical graphics to creative and less standard plots, at the points of most important human decisions when other ways to validate those decisions can be difficult. Visualization approaches are used to understand both the data that serves as input for machine learning and the models that practitioners create. In this talk, learn about the process of building a ML model in the real world, how and when practitioners use visualization to make more effective choices, and considerations for ML visualization tooling.
