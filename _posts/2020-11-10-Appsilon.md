# Descriptions of talk

### Preserving wildlife with computer vision
In this talk, I will discuss how we have managed to assist wildlife conservationists in their efforts in central Africa, using computer vision. I will touch on the modelling, the real life implementation and also share a treat for R lovers.

### Scaling Shiny Dashboards on a Budget
I will discuss being prepared for a high traffic load, and understanding the costs and requirements of hosting shiny apps on the cloud. All of this on the example of a shiny app deployed on Shiny Server Open Source and hosted on AWS.
