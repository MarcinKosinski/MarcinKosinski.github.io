On Thursday, February 28th at 7 pm UTC, as part of the Why R? Webinar series, we have the honour to host 
[Dr gwynn stuydevant](https://lish.harvard.edu/people/gwynn-sturdevant) from the Harvard Business School. She will 
talk about **vectorization** in R, using different cases to illustrate it.

Join us!

### Talk

#### Speaker
- [s. gwynn stuydevant, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gwynn-sturdevant-83694280/)
  <br>Dr. Gwynn Sturdevant is a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard Business School working on the Science of Science. She 
  developed an extensive Shiny application to assist in balancing trials as a post-doctoral fellow with Ken Kleinman 
  (University of Massachusetts, Amherst and Harvard University). Dr. Sturdevant has a PhD in Statistics from the University of 
  Auckland, the birthplace of R, where she studied under Thomas Lumley (University of Auckland and University of 
  Washington) and Ross Ihaka. She focused on finding long-term effects, after cessation of treatments, when noisy 
  measurements cross a threshold in biometric data.


#### Efficient computation with R
Current innovations in coding have focused on ease of learning and reading. Unfortunately, a byproduct of these features
is an increase in computation time for some coding. This talk will focus on vectorizing R code, or writing code that 
reduces computation times in some cases. The speaker will discuss 3 cases: bootstrapping to determine the population 
mean, finding eigenvectors for a matrix, and survival analysis with mismeasurement.
