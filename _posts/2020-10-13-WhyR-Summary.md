# Numbers

<img src="/images/fulls/whyr2020/summary/Slajd3.JPG" class="fit image"> This was the first virtual but the fourth edition of the annual conference devoted to R users in Central-Eastern Europe. This year we had a chance to gather participants from all over the world, thanks to the remote setup! We had +950 registered participants for lectures, 300 R users initially interested in [Text Mining Hackathon](https://2020.whyr.pl/hackathon/) and 220 taken seats for remote [2020.whyr.pl/workshops/](https://2020.whyr.pl/workshops/). In the end, during the week after the first published Keynote talk we observed **+16k views and 2.5k total watch hours**.

# Workshops

<img src="/images/fulls/whyr2020/summary/workshops.png" class="fit image">

Every conference is a great chance to attend a hands-on R workshop! This year we were lucky enought to host such qualified and enthusiastic workshop tutors. We also had a chance to organize an R workshop related to Legal basics for data scientists and Innovation Box (IP Box) in Poland. Below is the list or workshops organized at WhyR2020.

During the break between morning and afternoon sessions in collaboration with [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/pl/careers/careers-in-poland) we also hosted a **Recruiting Panel** - [Lessons learned from 500+ interviews for data science jobs](https://github.com/WhyR2020/abstracts/tree/master/panel)

# Hackathon

**A language agnostic competition devoted to text mining where every machine learning practitioner could find challenges to test his/her team!**

The full summary of the hackathon can be read in [this blog post](http://r-addict.com/2020/10/09/WhyR-Hackathon-Summary.html).

<img src="/images/fulls/whyr2020/hackathon/hackathon2020.jpg" class="fit image">

A day before the conference we organized **Text Mining** [2020.whyr.pl/hackathon/](https://2020.whyr.pl/hackathon/) at [Why R?](http://whyr.pl). This was an event that aimed to promote knowledge related to text analyses. We prepared [4 various challenges](https://github.com/WhyR2020/hackathon#descriptions-of-challenges) so that teams were able to pick tasks that suit their skills best. At the beginning of last week we published videos presenting winning solutions on [youtube.com/WhyRFoundation](https://youtube.com/WhyRFoundation) channel. 

We had an initial 300 participants interested in joining the hackathon before we even announced the theme and challenges. 2 weeks before the event start we announced it's going to relate to the text mining and that we are aiming to get group submissions of a size of 4 or 5 team members. Around 60 people from all over the world formed 13 teams, from which 7 teams submitted at least one solution for any of the challenges presented at the hackathon. We've seen people from Australia, India, Germany, Poland, Senegal, US, Canada, Nepal, Spain, UK, Brazil!
