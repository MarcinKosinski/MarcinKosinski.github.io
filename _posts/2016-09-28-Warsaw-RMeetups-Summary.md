<img src="/images/fulls/supeRRR.jpg" class="fit image"> Warsaw R and Data Analytics Enthusiast group is an effort that aims at integrating users of the R language in Warsaw, Poland. Our group has over 970 members at its [meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Spotkania-Entuzjastow-R-Warsaw-R-Users-Group-Meetup/). In this post I provide a summary of our group, our last 2 meetups before this season ending and I present plans for the future. Check who we are, what are we talking about, what are our future meetings about and how you can become a member or a co-organizer of Warsaw R Enthusiasts events.

We have been meeting for 3 years now and have organized 19 regular meetups with speakers' session (2x30-35min speeches, sometimes 3x30min). At every gathering we provide free pizza and organize an afterparty to improve the networking. Our local group is strong and our speakers are always up to date with the newest R inventions and discoveries. With local [Data Science Academic Society](http://datascience.mini.pw.edu.pl/) and [MI2 group](https://github.com/orgs/mi2-warsaw/people) we have even organized [6 R workshops](http://mi2.mini.pw.edu.pl/index.php/nasze-warsztaty/) and [Team Data Analytics MiNI-Marathon](https://www.facebook.com/events/921016974586900/)

# Last Season Finale

Before holidays, at [18th meeting](https://www.meetup.com/Spotkania-Entuzjastow-R-Warsaw-R-Users-Group-Meetup/events/228608011/), we had a pleasure to listen to Data Scientist, Michał Janusz, who talked about R usage in the improvement of global paper industry. We also had a possibility to learn more about [Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) package from Data Analyst [Zygmunt Zawadzki](https://github.com/zzawadz) who during presentation mentioned his new Rcpp reimplementation of [FSelector](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FSelector/index.html) package - the [FSelectorRcpp](https://github.com/mi2-warsaw/FSelectorRcpp) package. Later, on [19th meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Spotkania-Entuzjastow-R-Warsaw-R-Users-Group-Meetup/events/228534770/) called `SER 19 %>% PwC <- XGBoost + SQLServer2016 `, we were pleased to listen to 2 Data Scientists from [PwC Poland](http://www.pwc.pl/): [Mateusz Luczko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateusz-%C5%82uczko-078ab587) and [Piotr Bochnia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piotrbochnia) who presented the [XGBoost](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xgboost/index.html) package and R integration with SQL Server 2016. Extreme Gradient Boosting is a new approach to predictive analytics and an algorithm that is a new benchmark of performance in kaggle competitions. SQL Server integration is a great opportunity for R users working with [Microsoft R Open](https://mran.microsoft.com/open/) and [MRAN](https://mran.microsoft.com/).

All past presentations can be found on our [website](http://mi2-warsaw.github.io/SER/) (still only in polish) or on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mi2-warsaw/SER).

# Future Plans - New Season

We are co-working with R meetups organizers from various polish cities like [eRka](http://www.erkakrakow.pl/) (Cracow), [Estymator](http://estymator.ue.poznan.pl/) (Poznań), [Data Science Wrocław](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Wroclaw/), [Data Science Łódź](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Lodz/) or [Academic Data Science (Gdańsk)](http://www.meetup.com/Academic-Data-Science/).

This year we all co-organize in October the [European R Users Meeting - eRum 2016](http://erum.ue.poznan.pl/)

<img src="/images/fulls/erum_black.jpg" class="fit image">

But just before that you can meet us on [10th Cracow R Users Group meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Cracow-R-User-Group/events/233624341/) to listen [Marta Karaś](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martakaras) talking about Convex Clustering and Biclustering with application in R and [me](http://r-addict.com/About.html) trying to explain Docker - Rocker: explanation and motivation for Docker containers usage in applications development [by R user, for R users]. You are welcome to join the meeting!

### In Warsaw

Shortly after eRum2016 we are hosting [R Ladies Warsaw](http://www.meetup.com/Spotkania-Entuzjastow-R-Warsaw-R-Users-Group-Meetup/events/233908062/) - a workshop event with 4 simultaneous sessions about basics of R and [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) package. You are still welcome to participate!

Then there is a plan [R and Bio-informatics/Medical statistics](http://www.meetup.com/Spotkania-Entuzjastow-R-Warsaw-R-Users-Group-Meetup/events/234290359/) meetup in Novembver and we are still looking for presenters on [R and data vis](http://www.meetup.com/Spotkania-Entuzjastow-R-Warsaw-R-Users-Group-Meetup/events/234328394/) meetup in December. Feel free to write to me if you are interested in presenting any state of the art graphics tips and tricks!
