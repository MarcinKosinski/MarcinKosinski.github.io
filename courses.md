# Integrative Omics Data Analysis: Tools and Techniques for Multi-Omics Studies

## Overview:

The proposed course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the methods, techniques, and software tools used in the integrative analysis of multi-omics data. The course is intended for researchers, bioinformaticians and data scientists interested in analyzing and interpreting multi-omics data, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics.

The course is divided into several independent modules, each covering a different aspect of integrative omics data analysis. The modules are taught through lectures, tutorials, and practical exercises. The course covers the following topics:

### Module 1: Introduction to Omics Data Analysis

- Overview of omics data types and their applications
- Data preprocessing, normalization, and quality control
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing

### Module 2: Machine Learning for Advanced Omics Data Analysis

- Introduction to machine learning
- Supervised and unsupervised learning methods
- Deep learning and neural networks
- Benchmarking and validation of predictive models

### Module 3: Single-Omics Data Analysis

- Genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data analysis
- Differential expression analysis
- Pathway and functional enrichment analysis

### Module 4: Multi-Omics Data Integration

- Data integration methods and techniques
- Network analysis and visualization
- Correlation and co-expression analysis


### Module 5: Applications of Omics Data Analysis

- Disease diagnosis and prognosis in the context of survival analysis
- Drug discovery and development supported by generative adversarial networks
- Precision medicine

## Price and duration

Each module of the course is designed to last for 8 days, consisting of two submodules of 4 days each. We have priced each module at 6,000 EUR (28,000 PLN), and this represents excellent value for the quality of training and expertise that we can offer, including the access to training materials tailored to your needs.
