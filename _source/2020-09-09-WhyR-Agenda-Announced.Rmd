<img src="/images/fulls/whyr2020/updated_cover2020_small.jpg" class="fit image"> The fourth edition of Why R? Conference ([2020.whyr.pl](https://2020.whyr.pl/)) is starting in 2 weeks! It was planned for September 24-27 2020 and happens remotely. Some pre-events, like **Text Mining Hackathon** start on 23rd (and lasts till the end of 24th). Have a look at this blog post to find out a big-picture agenda, proposed workshops and details around lectures. There are still seats on some workshops if you're willing to participate. Simply visit the registration page [2020.whyr.pl/register/](https://2020.whyr.pl/register/).

# Agenda of the conference

<img src="/images/fulls/whyr2020/agenda.jpg" class="fit image"> 
We start the event with a Text Mining Hackathon (more to come - [whyr.pl/2020/hackathon](http://whyr.pl/foundation/2020/hackathon/)). Julia Silge, our keynote, who works as  a data scientist and software engineer at RStudio PBC will give a kickoff talk on the evening of 23rd September. The day of 24th is reserved for the Hackathon that ends with a Sponsored Talk by McKinsey & Company, golden sponsor of the conference.
