The text analysis package quanteda is now a mature package with a large user base, and interwoven with a growing family of related packages for machine learning, text conversion, part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing, and sentiment analysis. I outline the reasons why you should be using it and what it can do for your natural language processing and text analysis needs.
