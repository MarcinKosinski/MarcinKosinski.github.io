<img src="/images/fulls/whyr2020/cover2020.jpg" class="fit image"> Three editions of [Why R?](http://whyr.pl/) conferences were a great networking success. During each edition, we gathered around 250-300 R enthusiasts from Europe and we managed to carry out more than 35 workshops. Desire for a bigger event led us to the 4th edition!

# About **Why R? 2020** conference

We are more than happy to announce that Why R? 2020 Conference will be organized by [Why R? Foundation](http://whyr.pl/tags/#info). The fourth official meeting of Central European R enthusiasts will be held in Warsaw from the 27th to the 30th of August 2020. Since English is the official language of the meeting, we would love to invite R users from other countries.

# Pre-meetings

We are organizing pre-meetings in many European cities to cultivate the R experience of knowledge sharing. If you have doubts about visiting the upcoming event, you can discover photos and presentations from the previous ones and make sure whether you are interested. There are still few meetings that may be organized and are not yet added to the map. If you are interested in co-organizing a Why R? pre-meeting in your city, let us know (via kontakt_at_whyr.pl). The [Why R? Foundation](http://whyr.pl/#blog) can help you search for the speakers!
