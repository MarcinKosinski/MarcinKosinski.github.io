Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers reliable, scalable, and inexpensive cloud computing services. In this talk I will present how to setup environment to run R code for use cases like: big data processing, connection to databases, containerization of products, hosting APIs, running and serving machine learning algorithms. I will describe most information an R user needs to know when starting the journey with AWS and crucial systems that can be useful for a data scientist.
