<img src="/images/fulls/archivist_github.png" class="fit image">Have you ever suffered because of the impossibility of reproducing graphs, tables or analysis' results in R? Have you ever bothered yourself for not being able to share R objects (i.e., plots or final analysis models) within your reports, posters or articles? Or maybe simply you have too many objects you can’t manage to store in a convenient and handy way? Now you can share partial results of analysis, provide hooks to valuable R objects within articles, manage analysis' results and restore objects’ pedigree with [archivist](http://pbiecek.github.io/archivist/Posts.html) package and its extension [archivist.github](http://r-addict.com/archivist.github/), allautomatically through [GitHub](https://github.com/) without closing RStudio. If you are tired of archiving results by yourself, then read how you can became an R Hero with the [archivist.github](http://r-addict.com/archivist.github/) package power.

# R Hero archiving power

Recently I've visited Backup City, a data analysis mecca in the middle of Reproducible Research RLand. That's where I ovearheared a feverish discussion between R Hero and commissar O'Rdon. You can read the story of their meeting at the opening comic.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(archivist.github)
load("github_token.rda");load("password.rda")
if (file.exists("RHero/gallery")) {
deleteLocalRepo(repoDir = 'RHero', deleteRoot = TRUE)
deleteGitHubRepo(repo = "RHero", github_token = github_token, user = "archivistR", deleteRoot = TRUE)
}
```

# archivist.gitub: archivist and GitHub integration

archivist.github is a package with tools for archiving, managing and sharing R objects via GitHub and is the extension of the archivist. You can install package from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/archivist.github/index.html)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('archivist.github')
```

I have prepared a workflow graph to visualize functionalities of archivist.github

<img src="/images/fulls/archivist_github_workflow.png" class="fit image">

and provide explanation of core powers in this post.

After you've created a GitHub developer application (the process is described at [archivist.github: 2.1 OAuth open autorization](http://r-addict.com/archivist.github/#21_oauth_open_autorization), set: Homepage URL - http://github.com, Authorization callback URL - http://localhost:1410) you will be able to automatically create repositories on GitHub from R console.
Below is an example on how to authorise with GitHub API (using your application Client ID and Client Secret), create a GitHub repository with [archivist-like Repository](http://pbiecek.github.io/archivist/staticdocs/Repository.html) and automatically archive R object on GitHub

```{r}
# I saved some variables earlier 
# no to provide them publicly
load("github_token.rda");load("password.rda")

library(archivist.github)
# this can be done only in interactive mode
# so have to be done before knitr compilation
#
# authoriseGitHub(ClientID, ClientSecret,
# scope = c("public_repo", "delete_repo")) ->
# github_token 
#
# repository creation
createGitHubRepo(repo = "RHero", 
                 user = "archivistR", 
                 password = password,
                 github_token = github_token,
                 default = TRUE)
# -> https://github.com/archivistR/RHero
```
```{r, results='hide'}
# parameters can be set globally,
# so you will not have to specify 
# them for each call
aoptions("password", password)
aoptions("user", "archivistR") 
aoptions("repo", "RHero")
aoptions("github_token", github_token)
```

```{r, results='asis'}
# archiving on GitHub
archive(iris, alink = TRUE)
```

<img src="/images/fulls/github_R.jpg" class="fit image">

One can check that the artifact is really on GitHub and that the [commit was performed](https://github.com/archivistR/RHero/commits/master) (with great help of [git2r](https://github.com/ropensci/git2r) package)

```{r}
# sometimes GitHub need more 
# time to react
Sys.sleep(60)
# show archived objects with their hashes
archivist::showRemoteRepo()
# one can check how many commits have been performed so far
length(
   jsonlite::fromJSON(
      rawToChar(
httr::GET('https://api.github.com/repos/archivistR/RHero/commits')$content)
      )$sha
)
```

Each object (referred as [artifact](http://pbiecek.github.io/archivist/staticdocs/archivist-package.html)) is archived with it's metadata and [md5hash](http://pbiecek.github.io/archivist/staticdocs/md5hash.html) in case someone would like to [restore or search for archived objects](http://r-addict.com/archivist.github/#23_archiving_and_exploring_example) within [Repository](http://pbiecek.github.io/archivist/staticdocs/Repository.html).

# Partial results archiving and objects’ pedigree restoration

[We](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/graphs/contributors) have prepared extended version of [pipe - %>%](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html) operator [%a%](http://pbiecek.github.io/archivist/staticdocs/magrittr.html) so that every partial result of analysis workflow can be archived. Below is an example of workflow archiving for [RTCGA](http://rtcga.github.io/RTCGA/) (about which I wrote [here](http://r-addict.com/2016/05/04/RTCGA-Quick-Guide.html)) RNASeq data (genes' expression) (broader example can be find [here](http://r-addict.com/archivist.github/#3_advanced_example_with_rtcga)) and it's pedigree restoration

```{r, results='hide'}
# This sets `silent=TRUE` in saveToRepo
# which is used by %a% . There will be 
# no warning printed about archiving 
# the same artifact or it's data twice.
aoptions('silent', TRUE)
aoptions('repoDir', 'RHero')
 # %a% archives to Local Repos, that's
# why we need 'repoDir'
```
```{r}
#
# information about genes' expressions
library(RTCGA.rnaseq); data(BRCA.rnaseq)
library(dplyr)
BRCA.rnaseq %a%
    select(`TP53|7157`, 
           bcr_patient_barcode) %a%
    # bcr_patient_barcode contains a key to 
    # merge patients between various datasets
    rename(TP53 = `TP53|7157`) %a%
    filter(substr(bcr_patient_barcode, 
                  14, 15) == "01" ) -> 
    # 01 at the 14-15th position tells 
    # these are cancer sample
    BRCA.rnaseq.TP53
```

```{r, results='asis'}
# knitr: results='asis'.
# give hooks to objects
ahistory(BRCA.rnaseq.TP53,
         format = "kable",
         alink = TRUE ) 
# it uses global user and repo
# if they are not specified
```

Column with `[[env]]` is the object before transformations. We are working on using original names for objects in [this issue](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/269).

This operation does not archive objects automatically on GitHub as this is functionality from base archivist package. One have to upload objects with

```{r, echo=1}
pushGitHubRepo()
Sys.sleep(60)
```
```{r}
# one can check how many commits have been performed so far
length(
   jsonlite::fromJSON(
      rawToChar(
httr::GET('https://api.github.com/repos/archivistR/RHero/commits')$content)
      )$sha
)
```

# Overload `print()` to use `archive()`

After global parameters specification (aoptions() function sets 'user', 'repo', and 'password' parameters for each archivist.github and archivist function globally) we don't have to use `archive` function after each call to provide hooks in rmarkdown reports. We can overload `print()` function for specific classes so that after printing objects will be also evaluated with `archive` function.

```{r}
addHooksToPrintGitHub(class = "lm")
```

```{r, results='asis'}
# knitr: results='asis'
pld <- aread("MarcinKosinski/Museum/04eb0bdc12")
(lm.D9 <- lm(weight ~ group,
             data = pld))

(lm.D90 <- lm(weight ~ group - 1,
              data = pld))
```

This is the GitHub equivalent for local archiving with [addHooksToPrint](http://pbiecek.github.io/archivist/staticdocs/addHooksToPrint.html)

# [Feedback and Notes](http://marcinkosinski.github.io/archivist.github/#6_feedback_and_notes)

If you have any comments or user request, please see [Feedback and Notes](http://marcinkosinski.github.io/archivist.github/#6_feedback_and_notes) section to be aware of our future plans.

More examples can be checked at [archivist.github Tutorial](http://r-addict.com/archivist.github/) or you can learn more during [@pbiecek]() talk [How to use the archivist package to boost reproducibility of your research](http://schedule.user2016.org/event/7BYx/how-to-use-the-archivist-package-to-boost-reproducibility-of-your-research) at [useR2016 Conference](schedule.user2016.org/).

If you'd like to meet more R Heroes then restore message that was archived for commisar O'Rdon with
```{r}
# library(archivist.github)
cat(aread("MarcinKosinski/archivist.github/eRum2016/010e596"))
```
