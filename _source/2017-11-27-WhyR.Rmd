<img src="/images/fulls/whyr/intro1.jpg" class="fit image"> Last Polish R conference was organized in 2014 in Poznań - since then many R meetups took place in Poland in 3 big cities. Find out the amount of people registering for meetups in the above graph (data taken from meetup.com). The head of the organizing committee of the 2014 conference also organized an [European R Users Meeting](http://erum.ue.poznan.pl/) in 2016 with almost 300 participants from various countries across Europe. This meeting was a trigger for 2 new R users groups in Poland. I wonder what events we will observe after 2017 edition?

As part of the gratitude we have prepared special gifts (with a help of Klaudia from [Pędzlenie](https://www.facebook.com/pedzlenie)). Each invited speaker got a hand-made painting with a place characteristic to Warsaw with an extra 3D print of the Palace of Culture and Science (thanks to [MI2DataLab](https://mi2datalab.github.io/MI2DataLab_webpage/)) that is the most recognizable building in Warsaw. All covered in a **jar** - unofficial symbol of our city.

Conference is always a kind place for networking and a special opportunity to keep up with the newest trends and achievements of the science. One can exchange experiences and comments with the people from the industry. We shouldn't forget that this is also a huge organizational effort for all people involved in the strategic planning and organization. Preparations for the conference started 300 days before the event.


# Conference in numbers

As a statistician I naturally like tables and numbers so I have prepared a summary of the conference in numbers.
I can't believe we've made so many GitHub commits.
