# About the **Why R? 2018** conference

<img src="/images/fulls/whyr2018/back.jpeg" class="fit image">

We are pleased to announce that Why R? 2018 Conference will be organized by [STWUR (Wroclaw R Users Group)](https://www.meetup.com/Wroclaw-R-Users-Group/). The second official meeting of Polish R enthusiasts will be held in Wroclaw 2-5 July 2018. As the meeting is held in English, we are happy to invite R users from other countries.

The main topic of this conference is very strongly based around mlr R package for machine learning (over 4500 downloads per month). The creator of the package, Bernd Bischl, will be an invited speaker of the Why R? 2018 and more people involved in the project will conduct workshops and give specialized talks on the mlr ecosystem. With that strong focus on machine learning, we hope to gather broader audience, including people for whom the R is a side-interest, but they are keen on learning more about data science.
