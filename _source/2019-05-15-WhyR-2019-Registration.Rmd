<img src="/images/fulls/whyr2019/tlosptronam_small.jpg" class="fit image"> Two editions of [Why R?](http://whyr.pl/) conferences were a great networking success. We gather 200-300 R enthusiasts from Europe during each edition and were able to host more than 25 workshops together. The hunger for a bigger event led us to the 3rd edition!
