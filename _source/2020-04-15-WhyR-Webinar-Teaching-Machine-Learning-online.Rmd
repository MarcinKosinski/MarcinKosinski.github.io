# Abstract

The course "Introduction to Machine Learning" is designed as a flipped classroom course. That means the lecture part of the course is presented online with videos, online quizzes and coding exercises while the in-person classes are spent answering questions and solving and discussing exercises in an interactive fashion. 
Due to the COVID-19 crisis, we were not able to teach the class in person this year but had to go virtual. In this talk I will discuss how we successfully moved online and how you can contribute and copy what we did using our openly licensed course material (see https://compstat-lmu.github.io/lecture_i2ml/).
