<img src="/images/fulls/uber-survminer.png" class="fit image"> We are celebrating the 1st anniversary of the survminer's release on CRAN! Due to that fact I have prepared the most (uber platinum) customized survival plot that I could imagine. I went too far because it took over 30 parameters to create a graph.. 

[survminer](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survminer/index.html), a package for drawing easily beautiful and 'ready-to-publish' survival curves with the 'number at risk' table and 'censoring count plot', has became very popular at the end of a previous year. It happend due to 3 great methodology posts about Cox Proportional Hazards model and Survival Analysis basics by Alboukadel Kassambara ([kassambara](https://github.com/kassambara/)) published on [STDHA](http://www.sthda.com/english/)

- [Survival Analysisc Basics](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/survival-analysis-basics)
- [Cox Proportional Hazards Model](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/cox-proportional-hazards-model)
- [Cox Model Assumptions](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/cox-model-assumptions)

If you are working in the survival analysis field, you might be interested in reading the post covering the newest features in survminer: [survminer 0.2.4](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/survminer-0-2-4)

Right now, after a year of the first CRAN release, survminer has been downloaded [11k times](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/survminer) and has been used and cited in several research articles:

- [Primary resistance to PD-1 blockade mediated by JAK1/2 mutations](http://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/content/candisc/early/2016/12/01/2159-8290.CD-16-1223.full.pdf)

Due to the celebration of it's 1st anniversary on CRAN, I have prepared a long survival graph of Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival curves, where each option is described below. I think I went too far to present the possible customization of the graph because this example takes over 30 parameters!
