<img src="/images/fulls/webinars/achim.jpg" class="fit image">

We are excited to present our first webinar speaker: [Achim Zeileis from Universität Innsbruck](https://eeecon.uibk.ac.at/~zeileis/).
The topic of the webinar is **R/exams: A One-for-All Exams Generator - Online Tests, Live Quizzes, and Written Exams with R** which is a very good suite for teachers facing the need of
the remote R teaching!

Speaker's biogram and the abstract of the talk is available [on a meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/Spotkania-Entuzjastow-R-Warsaw-R-Users-Group-Meetup/events/269589118/) and on [the webinar url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnyCR7q4P4Q) that is also visible from [youtube.com/c/WhyRFoundation](https://www.youtube.com/c/WhyRFoundation) YouTube channel.
